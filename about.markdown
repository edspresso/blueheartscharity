# The One Dollar Mission

Dear Reader,

In July of 2023, my grandmother suddenly passed away. Stress was her struggle, and her health suffered for it. Since then, my other grandmother was diagnosed with brain cancer. I am young, and I donâ€™t have much money yet. So, I am asking if everyone  who sees this can give just $1. All proceeds would go to my grandmother, for her recovery, and to help her desperate living situation. 

This account is the only way I know to get others to listen. If you see this, are willing and able, and want to help someone hurt and dying choose life, then consider helping our cause.

As we raise money, we will provide updates on how these funds are helping out her treatment, living situation, and amenities.

Right now, our goal is $1/day. Hopefully, we can aim higher soon! Thanks for reading!

Sincerely,
- Blue Hearts, Charity
